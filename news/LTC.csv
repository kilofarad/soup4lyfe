Pointing to recent failings of social media sites Facebook and hinting that far better privacy options are around the corner, he stated: “The cat is out of the bag.” In a fireside chat with Charlie Lee, founder of Litecoin, a cryptocurrency based on Bitcoin’s code, Chaum spoke broadly about the future of digital privacy.

David Bailey, CEO of BTC Media, moderated the talk. People are more conscience of privacy because the scope of privacy has changed, Chaum said. In the past, the focus was on how to shield personal information; now the concern is more around the vast accumulation of metadata. “People are more aware of the dangers of being tracked,” he said. Switching the topic to his own project, the father of online anonymity, who is known for his ambitious projects in the past, boasted that Elixxir is capable of processing hundr...",2018-10-24 15:02:40,bitcoinmagazine,Bitcoin|Events,David Chaum on Digital Privacy: “The Cat Is Out of the Bag”

"                        Crypto-to-USD lender BlockFi has announced that it will support loans backed by both Litecoin and Gemini’s recent stablecoin token GUSD. This is the first time the company is expanding to accept collateral in one of the crypto industry’s top-10 assets besides bitcoin and ether. In addition, BlockFi is also the first crypto-backed lender to support loans backed by GUSD.Founded in 2017, BlockFi offers both debt and credit products and seeks to bring liquidity to the cryptocurrency space. Based in New York, the company operates in over 40 states and is backed by some of the country’s leading financial firms including PJC and ConsenSys Ventures, as well as Galaxy Digital Ventures LLC, which provided the company with nearly $53 million in capital during a funding round in July 2018. This marked the first investment into crypto-backed loans from an institutional enterprise. Zac Prince is the company CEO. Speaking with Bitcoin Magazine, he said that BlockFi’s acceptance of Litecoin was a “logical first step” toward supporting most — if not all — of the world’s top 10 cryptocurrencies. “Litecoin was recently added to Gemini and has a long history of price appreciation,” he commented. “Having large, imbedded capital gains is one of the motivating factors for considering a loan backed by crypto. Litecoin also has strong liquidity with USD pairs in multiple trading venues.” With the addition of GUSD, BlockFi can o...",2018-10-16 13:07:41,bitcoinmagazine,Bitcoin|Digital assets,BlockFi Now Offers Litecoin and Gemini Stablecoin-Backed Loan Options

They’re prototyping a machine for Ethereum, as well. Innosilicon began producing Bitcoin ASIC miners this year, and it was among the first manufacturers to implement overt AsicBoost into its hardware. Seeing as roughly 5 percent of Bitcoin blocks today are mined using overt AsicBoost, Innosilicon’s machines likely account for most of this activity.Enter the T3Scheduled for release in December of 2018, the company’s third generation Bitcoin miner builds on its predecessor’s architecture with some added improvements.“We experimented with many differe...",2018-09-20 22:04:41,bitcoinmagazine,Bitcoin|Mining,Innosilicon’s Impending ASIC Miner Could Challenge Bitmain’s Dominance

OKEx is the second largest global exchange by volume, according to CoinMarketCap, (though that volume has been called into question) and now OKCoin is hoping that its own volume will increase with low fees in a market-maker favored pricing model.OKEx was launched in 2014 to target peer-to-peer trading of hundreds of cryptocurrency pairs. The digital asset exchange was to supplant the 2013 version of OKCoin, which enabled Chinese Yuan to BTC payments. However, the past 18 months of regulatory changes amongst major economies have left OKEx unable to cater to investors and speculators in many countries, including the United States. OKCoin international was relaunched only in April of this year and had previously only operated in California as a fiat-to-token trading platform earlier this summer, so this token-to-token platform should enable a U.S. service to OKCoin previously denied to OKEx. Given its currently limited pool of tradeable cryptocurrencies (BTC, LTC, ETC, ETH, and BCH), it may be hard to differentiate OKCoin from U.S. mainstays.

Debuting in February 2018, the Lightning Ramp was built to help exchanges connect with the Lightning Network, thereby giving millions of customers access to speedy Bitcoin and Litecoin payment options. During the project’s development, several issues, such as those involving key management, were uncovered that got in the way of mainstream Lightning adoption but adding a Lightning node to the mix is expected to resolve many of these problems. In a Medium post, co-founder and CEO of Lightning Ramp Michael Borglin states, “When we met the Casa team, we were surprised to find that they previously built (but did not release) a multi-chain personal device in Q3 of 2017.

It connects brokers who wish to execute monetary swaps; provides orderbook updates; and mitigates fraud and market manipulation. The Relayer also assists users with agreeing on swap prices and executes trades over payment channel networks like the Lightning Ne...",2018-08-10 15:32:04,bitcoinmagazine,Bitcoin|Startups|Technical,Lightning Network Payment System “SparkSwap” Makes Its Official Debut

"                        Abra is a bitcoin-powered investment and payments app that first came to light at Launch Festival 2015 where it won the top prize at the event. The app uses bitcoin and litecoin smart contracts to represent the value of practically any fiat currency along with 20 crypto assets in the user’s wallet, where the user is always in complete control of their own private keys.While Abra was originally pitched as an app for permissionless, borderless money transfers, the startup is now entering the realm of “crypto banking.” Abra CEO Bill Barhydt explained this change of focus in a recent interview with angel investor Jason Calacanis on This Week in Startups.What Is Abra?Abra was founded in 2014 when the bitcoin price was on the decline. At that time (and some would argue still today), the two main use cases of bitcoin were as a store of value (digital gold) and a conduit for permissionless, digital payments (think Wikileaks donations).According to Barhydt, it was at this time that Abra decided to try out another often-touted use case of this new technology: programmable money. Through the use of multisignature contracts and oracles, Abra has been able to peg the value of the bitcoin (and now litecoin) in a user’s wallet to their local fiat currency. This effectively gives the user the permissionless nature of bitcoin without the price volatility.Unlike other apps, such as Coinbase, that allow users to convert b...",2018-04-10 18:13:22,bitcoinmagazine,Bitcoin|Startups,Bill Barhydt on Abra’s Pivot From P2P Money Transfers to “Crypto Banking”

"  Proof of Work (PoW) mining operations, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, use a tremendous amount of energy and generate a tremendous amount of waste heat. Qarnot is one of a number of growing companies that has found a way to turn that waste heat into controlled heating for the home or office.The new Qarnot QC-1 ""crypto heater"" takes advantage of an obvious synergy: It makes use of the waste heat generated by mining crypto in the guise of an attractive space heater. Spec wise, the QC-1 contains two GPUs: NITRO+ RADEON RX 580 8G 60 MH/s at 650W. Local electrical costs and climate are key determining factors with regard to recouping costs and making a profit; for example, if you are in a cold northern environment with cheap electricity like Quebec, then your costs to run it should be low enough (about $0.03 KWh USD) that the mining revenue should pay for the device in a few years.The device mines Ethereum by default but can be configured to mine various other PoW-based cryptocurrencies such as Litecoin. A mobile app is available to monitor your account and configure the unit. The lack of fans or hard drives leads Qarnot to claim the system is “perfectly noiseless.” Over the years, there has been increasing concern over centralized mining and the diminishing ability of individuals to be able to mine successfully. While they are certainly efficient, centralized PoW mining centers compromise key features such as censorship resistance.
