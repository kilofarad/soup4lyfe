"                        Amun AG, a startup in Zug, Switzerland, has received a license from Swiss authorities to offer a new cryptocurrency exchange-traded product (ETP).An ETP is a blanket term to denote a security that derives its price from an underlying asset (e.g. a currency, commodity, stock) and is traded on a regulated stock exchange. It could refer to a number of exchange-traded investment options, including exchange-traded funds (ETF), exchange-traded commodities (ETC) and exchange-traded notes (ETN).Anum has referred to the instrument only as an ETP, and it’s unclear at this time whether or not it is characteristically an ETF, ETC or an ETN. Amun AG has stated that its ETP will be based on a collection of the top five most liquid crypto assets, which it refers to as “HODL5.” The currencies contained within the ETP will be bitcoin, ether, Ripple’s XRP, litecoin and bitcoin cash. The company will purchase cryptocurrency using cash from its customers. The assets will then be transferred into custodial hands, for which the company will charge management fees of roughly 2.5 percent.The fund also sources its pricing from the MVIS, an index for institutional-grade price tracking that was developed by VanEck.Amun’s CEO Hany Rashwan explains, “The Amun ETP will give institutional investors that are restricted to investing only in securities or do not want to set up custody for digital assets exposure to cryptocurrencies.

"                        In the latter half of 2018, few developments have occupied crypto investors’ headspaces like the industry’s indefatigable pursuit of a bitcoin exchange traded fund (ETF).This conversation lay largely dormant since the two brothers’ first attempt was rejected by the U.S. securities regulator in March of 2017. But the Winklevosses reignited the conversation when their second attempt at an ETF was shot down by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in July of this year. With the buzz back, the prospect (or failing prospects) of a bitcoin ETF have crowded the headlines of mainstream and crypto media alike. Following the Winklevosses’ failure to secure the coveted first-in-the-industry fund, the ensuing months would see a flurry of decision delays for existing applications, more rejections and revisions of said rejections.The sheer volume of news surrounding ETFs — and the general complexity of the asset when compared to the simplicity of trading on the bitcoin spot market — makes the industry’s pursuit of one a rich, complex and even abstruse topic.So let’s see if we can set the record straight.What an ETF Is and What It Means for BitcoinTo start, a short explanation: an ETF is a fund that holds an underlying asset or assets, be they stocks, commodities, bonds, etc., which are then divided into shares for investors to buy.

The main purpose of the program is to create an anonymous tip line as well as a whistleblower reward mechanism to deal with the problem of cryptocurrency scammers and hackers.The program aims to create a community within the crypto world that shares information about crypto bad actors while laying the groundwork for efficient punishment by law enforcement. The program hopes to create a sufficient deterrent against crypto crime, while rewarding those who come up with beneficial information toward this goal.Speaking with Bitcoin Magazine on the importance of the program, ECoinmerce COO Rex Chen said he was optimistic about the prospects of the program but believes getting “widespread buy-in and adoption” is critical.“The crypto scene revolves around collaboration, open source, transparency, etc. and this is an extension of that. We all complain about ‘FUD’ and warn each other about the dangers in the space (ex. don’t hold your funds on exchanges for a long time), but very little is actually being done about the dangers of scams, hacks, etc. If people can collaborate on self-policing the same way they collaborate on Github while coding, the industry will get much better as a whole regardin...",2018-08-21 16:07:51,bitcoinmagazine,Bitcoin|Law & justice,Crypto Industry Consortium Launches Self-Policing Program

"                        Streamr, the blockchain-based data platform based in Zug, Switzerland, launched their real-time data Marketplace on May 16, 2018, during a presentation at Consensus 2018. This was followed by an announcement of partnerships with Nokia and OSIsoft.The Streamr Marketplace connects data producers and consumers through a web-based application where data consumers can pay for access to real-time data streams listed by data providers. For example, a recent partnership between Streamr and Hewlett Packard Enterprise will allow vehicle data to be monetized in real-time. Vehicles generate data that is usable to third parties — it might be used to gauge traffic through a geographic region, or to fine-tune traffic signals, or to schedule road work, etc. Rather than just giving that data away for free, vehicle owners can make use of the Streamr Marketplace to monetize and trade that data. The use of the Streamr cryptographic token, DATA, will make it possible for data streams around the world to be freely tradable. The terms of use, pricing schedules and more are currently coded in Ethereum smart contracts, though Streamr has plans to support additional networks. The Streamr platform does not charge a transaction fee, but external fees from the blockchain network being used may apply. People acting as nodes on the network for Streamr will earn DATA as a reward for supporting the Marketplace and making it possible to...",2018-05-17 17:25:13,bitcoinmagazine,Bitcoin|Startups,"Streamr Launches Real-Time Data Marketplace, Partners With Nokia and OSIsoft"

"                        Blockchain identity verification platform Civic has emerged from Consensus 2018 with clear progress and updates for its identity attestation technology. The project imagines a network of validators and service providers who work together to verify individual identities. A new platform user would submit relevant identity information to a validation smart contract, which the validator would then review for approval. If approved, the validator would store references to this information on the blockchain, attesting to its validity. Anytime the corresponding user needs to submit identity information to another service provider (a bank, government agency, etc.), that service provider could request the validator to cross-check the user’s information with the blockchain’s attestations to verify their identity.In practice, such an ecosystem could streamline identity verification procedures and keep its users and participating service providers from having to go through lengthy ID checks whenever the occasion arises.Coming out of Consensus 2018, Civic is showing that it’s taking steps to turn theory into a reality. These steps include the first iteration of its ID codes protocol alongside its revamped token economy white paper, and — the kicker — the “world’s first crypto beer vending machine.”The idea of giving out free beer may seem kitschy at first glance, but its novelty is matched by what it means for Civic’...",2018-05-16 20:53:37,bitcoinmagazine,Bitcoin|Adoption & community|Privacy & security,"Civic Demos Proof of Concept With Beer Vending Machines, Launches ID Codes"

"                        On April 5, 2018, a blow to bitcoin occurred when the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) banned banks and regulated financial entities from dealing with cryptocurrency.Despite the media report that 10 percent of Bitcoin transactions happen in India, the news does not come as a surprise, considering how the nation has clamped down on cryptocurrency regulation so far this year. Since 2013, the nation’s financial regulators have warned about the difficulties of controlling cryptocurrencies and, like most other stricter regulatory governments, preventing the new asset classes’ most nefarious use cases: money laundering and terrorist financing. The Indian regulators’ treatment of cryptocurrency is even less of a surprise when considering what they have done in the past to their own fiat currency, the Indian rupee. Back in 2016, the RBI announced the demonetization (stripping a currency of its value) of all ₹500 and ₹1,000 banknotes of the Indian rupee, stating the action would help crack down on murky shadow economy activity (counterfeiting, terrorism, etc.). Based on this information, it’s not a stretch to assume that a seemingly anonymous and sovereignless computer currency should seem out of RBI’s monetary policy comfort zone.
