"                        Today, November 26, 2018, marks the launch of the Foundation for Interwallet Operability (FIO) and the FIO Protocol, an interwallet protocol that seeks to make the transfer of cryptos between wallets as simple and straightforward as making transfers on PayPal.“In the crypto world payments are exponentially more complex and cumbersome,” said David Gold, CEO of Dapix, a founding member of FIO. “Crypto payments feel too risky, too scary and too difficult for members of the public. You have to use an incoherent string of characters, and you can’t confirm if funds have arrived. The average person on the street simply will never feel comfortable using crypto unless this changes.”The FIO Protocol is intended to birth a range of features including cross-chain counterparty metadata, enabling transaction statuses within crypto wallets, the provision of a single cross-chain wallet name that’s hard to forget and more.Gold, in an email correspondence with Bitcoin Magazine, argues that “decentralized blockchain transactions” need to be easier and “less risky than fiat transactions.”He said, “Users need to have greater confidence that their blockchain transactions are accurate before they commit to sending. This challenge can’t be solved by an individual wallet or exchange as it lies at the interface between all of them. The FIO Protocol is an industry-led, decentralized solution that will enable easy-to-use and virtu...",2018-11-26 23:52:55,bitcoinmagazine,Bitcoin|Startups,New Foundation to Focus on Crypto Wallet Interoperability

The details are provided in a report originally published on November 13, 2018, that discussed how the bug was exploited by attackers, and what digital platforms could do if they wished to protect their hot wallet funds.It was unclear which exchanges could or could not be affected by the bug. Thus, private disclosures were issued to “as many exchanges as possible” according to a Medium post. While it was determined that most of these exchanges were not in any danger, all vulnerable exchanges have since instilled the proper protections. At press time, the bug is no longer considered a threat. According to its website, GasToken is an Ethereum-based contract that allows individuals to tokenize the Ethereum network through a special refund mechanism. Users can store gas when the price is low and garner refunds when it’s high. The website reads, “Every transaction on the network must include some gas, and the fee paid to miners for each transaction is directly proportional to the gas consumed by a transaction. GasToken allows a transaction to do the same amount of work and pay for less gas, saving on miner fees and costs and allowing users to bid higher gas prices without paying correspondingly higher fees.” The document alleges that many exchanges either enforced no gas...",2018-11-21 21:34:10,bitcoinmagazine,Bitcoin|Privacy & security,A Bug Making Ethereum Transactions on Exchanges Vulnerable Has Been Fixed

"                        Charles Hoskinson is best known today as a co-founder of both Ethereum and IOHK, where he leads the research, design and development of Cardano. But before these projects, there was Bitcoin. Back in 2013, he was the founding chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation’s education committee and established the Cryptocurrency Research Group.In an interview with Bitcoin Magazine during the recent StartEngine Summit, Hoskinson began by saying that he views Bitcoin as a series of experiments to try and realize two key concepts:“Can we achieve a decentralized form of value transfer or some sort of proto-money, and, instead of having a central entity issuing a token and securing it, can we release something decentralized with a secure ledger? And, if that happens, will it achieve real value in the marketplace?” In the early days, said Hoskinson, it wasn’t clear if this thing was going to survive or not. “It actually took several years for that to turn into the bitcoin we know and love,” he said. “It had huge volatility in price. The volume would be $1,000 a day, the hashrate would go way up and way down. Some people would say, ‘Eh, I don’t wanna mine anymore.’ They’d turn their computer off, and the network would lose 30 percent of its hashrate.” But the sea of change for Bitcoin took place in 2013. “As the market cap hit one billion, people started taking it really seriously.

"                        A South Korean ICO has defrauded its private sale investors out of roughly 13,500 ETH ($2.8 million) before disappearing from the internet entirely.Pure Bit, which has already pulled the plug on its website, has apparently conducted a fairly routine exit scam for its Pure Coin token sale. The cryptocurrency was pitched as an exchange token for Pure Bit, an exchange that was supposed to launch by the end of the month. The Coin  promised to give investors shares of the exchange’s trading revenue as well as discounted fees for trading, and its anonymous team claimed that it would burn 90% of token supply over a three year period. A block explorer for the ICO’s Ethereum wallet displays several in-bound transactions from investors beginning on November 4, 2018. On November 9, 2018, however, an initial 500 ether was transferred out, with the remaining 13,178 withdrawn 20 minutes later. Not all of the evidence of this company’s very existence was destroyed immediately, however. A thread on Reddit captured some of the last moments of the exchange and took several screenshots with translations from the original Korean. According to Reddit user u/Tbid, who evidently watched the saga unfold, Pure Bit was a crypto exchange that announced an ICO launch of an exchange token. Almost immediately after the ICO ended, however, all of the funds were spirited away to another single wallet address.

The ICO money would have supported grants for Civil newsrooms, as well as original journalistic work. Civil has said in the past it will refund people if it can’t raise enough to meet its goal.

"                        Binance, the largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, said that it will make new cryptocurrency listing fees transparent and donate 100 percent of those fees to charity.The exchange made the announcement today, October 8, 2018, in a blog post where it stated that a listing fee would now be more appropriately called a “donation.” Listing fees have been a pain point for cryptocurrency projects. Projects depend on getting their coins listed on exchanges for liquidity. News of getting listed on a major exchange can cause a coin to spike in value overnight. Yet, many projects have complained of exorbitant listing fees.  In April 2018, Bloomberg reported that according to Autonomous Research some crypto trading platforms were charging $1 million to $3 million to list a token — 10 times more than what a traditional exchange, like Nasdaq, demands for securities.  Binance, which now handles most of its operations out of Malta, has been a target of many of those complaints. In August 2018, Christopher Franko, co-founder of Expanse, a fork of Ethereum, tweeted that Binance wanted to charge 400 bitcoin ($2.5 million) to list a coin. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao refuted the accusation. “We don't list shitcoins even if they pay 400 or 4,000 BTC,” he tweeted.Now, according to Binance, cryptocurrency projects will be able to name their price. “Binance will not dictate a number, nor is there a minimum required l...",2018-10-08 19:20:59,bitcoinmagazine,Bitcoin|Digital assets,"Binance to Make Listing Fees Transparent, Give Proceeds to Charity"

Speaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Bancor’s Director of Communications Nate Hindman said the protocol will still allow users to trade Ethereum tokens, while its newest iteration, BancorX, will introduce this functionality to Ethereum’s rival, as well. “Bancor is not ‘switching’ to EOS. Bancor will continue to support and advance its protocol and liquidity network on the Ethereum blockchain. With the BancorX launch, we are expanding Bancor to also support the EOS blockchain.”Bancor’s announcement offers a comparative glance at EOS’s benefits over Ethereum. These include near-instant transaction times at 1 second, zero transaction fees and no front-running risks (i.e., unlike Ethereum’s gas structure, EOS transactions are not prioritized by adjustable fees).Reiterating tidbits of the blog post’s rationale in our conversation, Hindman also said that EOS has more than enough momentum behind it to warrant Bancor’s attention.“Our primary motivation in choosing which platforms to support is where we think there will be developer traction.

They’re prototyping a machine for Ethereum, as well. Innosilicon began producing Bitcoin ASIC miners this year, and it was among the first manufacturers to implement overt AsicBoost into its hardware. Seeing as roughly 5 percent of Bitcoin blocks today are mined using overt AsicBoost, Innosilicon’s machines likely account for most of this activity.Enter the T3Scheduled for release in December of 2018, the company’s third generation Bitcoin miner builds on its predecessor’s architecture with some added improvements.“We experimented with many differe...",2018-09-20 22:04:41,bitcoinmagazine,Bitcoin|Mining,Innosilicon’s Impending ASIC Miner Could Challenge Bitmain’s Dominance

Announcing her venture at the Ethereum Classic Summit in Seoul, South Korea, Chen’s new company, Linzhi, will focus on building cryptocurrency mining devices, and its first official products are a series of application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) miners designed specifically for Ethereum and Ethereum Classic.Ethereum ASIC miners are relatively new.

"                        Today, September 12, 2018, OKCoin announced that the company will be offering token-to-token only trading in twenty states across the U.S. This announcement of its expansion in U.S. markets comes shortly after OKCoin/OKEx founder Star Xu was questioned and released by Chinese police in connection with an alleged digital currency fraud. OKEx is the second largest global exchange by volume, according to CoinMarketCap, (though that volume has been called into question) and now OKCoin is hoping that its own volume will increase with low fees in a market-maker favored pricing model.OKEx was launched in 2014 to target peer-to-peer trading of hundreds of cryptocurrency pairs. The digital asset exchange was to supplant the 2013 version of OKCoin, which enabled Chinese Yuan to BTC payments. However, the past 18 months of regulatory changes amongst major economies have left OKEx unable to cater to investors and speculators in many countries, including the United States. OKCoin international was relaunched only in April of this year and had previously only operated in California as a fiat-to-token trading platform earlier this summer, so this token-to-token platform should enable a U.S. service to OKCoin previously denied to OKEx. Given its currently limited pool of tradeable cryptocurrencies (BTC, LTC, ETC, ETH, and BCH), it may be hard to differentiate OKCoin from U.S. mainstays. However, this limited pool may b...",2018-09-12 14:01:21,bitcoinmagazine,Bitcoin|Investing,OKCoin Expands Token-to-Token Platform to 20 States

"                        Ethereum is embracing the Constantinople milestone at the end of November 2018, after DevCon4 in Prague. Constantinople is the latest Ethereum release, introduced through a hard fork, that will include five Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs):Bitwise shifting instructions (EIP 145) in the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) allow for direct manipulation of bytes on the EVM layer.Skinny CREATE2 (EIP 1014) adds a new opcode that creates a contract but determines the deployed address differently to the existing CREATE opcode.The EXTCODEHASH opcode (EIP 1052) adds an opcode which returns the keccak256 hash of a contact’s byte code.Net gas metering for SSTORE (EIP 1283) introduces a new gas cost scheme for the SSTORE opcode.The difficulty bomb delay (EIP 1234) stabilizes block times and issuance by keeping block times at approximately 15 seconds for another 12 months and reducing block rewards to 2 ETH.To the regular application user, these updates offer nothing noticeably different, except perhaps an update to their Ethereum clients. For developers, these EIPs provide extended capabilities to the EVM, allowing for improved flexibility for smart contract development. All of these changes are backward compatible, ensuring previously deployed smart contracts remain usable and secure.This hard fork does not address scalability yet.

"                        As an emerging cog in the global digital economy,cloud mining offers a tool for enthusiasts to mine cryptocurrencies such asbitcoin without having to acquire hardware or other oft-required elements.

"                        IBM has launched a blockchain-based payment system called Blockchain World Wire. According to IBM, the new payment network uses digital currency on Stellar's blockchain to ""clear and settle cross-border payments"" in near real time.The Stellar network is a distributed, blockchain-based ledger that facilitates cross-asset transfers of value. Like Ripple, Stellar can handle exchanges between fiat-based currencies and digital assets. Using this protocol, IBM wants to make it possible for financial institutions to move money quickly and reliably, while cutting off intermediaries and complexities associated with traditional international payment systems.Speaking with Bitcoin Magazine, Jed McCaleb, co-founder of the Stellar Development Foundation, said, “IBM's implementation of the Stellar protocol has the potential to change the way money is moved around the world, helping to drastically improve international transactions and advancing financial inclusion in developing nations.""To use the new payment system, two financial institutions have to agree on the currency — a stablecoin or any digital asset — to be used as a bridge asset between any two fiat currencies. The companies will use their existing payment system, connected to World Wire's API, to convert the first fiat into a digital asset. World Wire will then convert the digital asset into the second fiat currency simultaneously, completing the transactio...",2018-09-05 20:49:17,bitcoinmagazine,Bitcoin|Payments,IBM Introduces 'World Wire' Payment System on Stellar Network

"                        Many of us are familiar with the term “DApp,” which stands for “decentralized application.”Foundationally, a DApp is an application that runs using blockchain technology on a decentralized network of computers instead of on a central database. Transactions via a DApp require the consensus of all users on the blockchain. For example, a financial transfer transacted via any DApp cannot be completed unless validated by all computers in the network, sometimes referred to in the blockchain environment as nodes. The funds will not be released and transferred until each node in the decentralized database has agreed upon the validity of the transaction. DApps are open-sourced software that run on top of other immutable blockchain technologies like Ethereum, allowing for greater transparency in transactions. DApps, although a fairly new concept at this point must, in general, meet the following criteria:DApps are open source. They are autonomously governed applications, with any changes decided by a consensus of users.DApps are decentralized. “Decentralized” is the “D” in “DApps.” Records of the application’s transactions are stored on an immutable, public and decentralized blockchain, thus protecting it from the ordinary risks of a central database, like hacking and other types of fraud.DApps must generate tokens.

"                        Under the new framework, Wyre's regulated money transfer infrastructure will be used to facilitate the instantaneous movement of “fiat currency directly into and out of Dai,” thereby removing the unpredictability of “speculative cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Bitcoin” and benefiting from the speed and security of the blockchain, a press release for the announcement states. The arrangement is designed to give customers a quick and secure money transfer protocol that offers full regulatory compliance.“Pairing Dai to Wyre’s trading engine and global fiat on-ramps and off-ramps will enable nearly-instant movement of funds across borders. By decreasing the amount of time it takes to clear payments, businesses can increase the number of payment cycles, therefore increasing revenue. Remittance platforms or crypto services can also settle instantly in Dai rather than using international wires which can take up to 48 hours,” the release continues.Through the partnership, Wyre now offers prospective users an Access Point Interface (API) to connect their bank accounts to the blockchain through Dai, while taking care of KYC/AML compliance and onboarding concerns. Using the API, users can now trade Dai against many of the world's major fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies including USD, GBP, EUR and more.Speaking with Bitcoin Magazine, Rune Christensen, CEO of MakerDAO, said the alliance would be beneficial to A...",2018-08-14 21:54:54,bitcoinmagazine,Bitcoin|Payments,Wyre Adds MakerDAO Stablecoin Pairing for Global Money Transfers
"                        This month, we celebrate Ethereum’s third birthday and reflect upon the many milestones that have occured in the industry since the dawn of the original smart contract blockchain. Mainstream interest is burgeoning, market capitalization for the industry has increased by over 5,900 percent, and the number of cryptocurrencies currently in circulation is at an all-time high. Up until recently, it seemed as if Ethereum would be one of the only platforms capable of fostering the mainstream adoption of blockchain technology. That is, until Cardano (ADA) appeared.While admittedly in its early stages, Cardano is already being labeled by some experts as a scalable solution to several of the inefficiencies created by Ethereum, which, some say, seems to be suffering from its own success. In recent months, the platform has been inundated with a slew of new decentralized applications (DApps) that are creating a bottleneck effect on the Ethereum blockchain. As famously portrayed by the meteoric rise of blockchain craze CryptoKitties, popular Ethereum applications require excessive bandwidth to remain afloat, which ultimately has a detrimental effect on network efficiency. And although ether’s hashrate is growing, it’s being far outpaced by the sheer number of projects being built on the blockchain.By contrast, Cardano has been specifically designed to handle high-volume transactions, operating on a first-of-its-kind ...",2018-08-14 18:53:10,bitcoinmagazine,Bitcoin|Op-ed,Op Ed: Evaluating the Promise of Cardano: Has Ethereum Met Its Match?

A wallet the Bancor team used to update the protocol’s smart contracts was infiltrated, and the $23.5 million vulnerability allowed the hackers to run off with $12.5 million ETH, $1 million NPXS tokens and $10 million of Bancor’s BNT token.Following the hack, the Bancor team froze the BNT in question in an effort to stanch its losses.The latest of its kind, the attack is an unfortunate reminder that smart contracts are not foolproof. Even built as they are on the blockchain’s security intensive network, they can feature bugs, backdoors and vulnerabilities that are ripe for exploitation. Before Bancor, we saw the popular Ethereum wallet Parity drained of 150,000 ETH (now worth just over $68 million) in July of 2017.

"                        Cryptocurrencies are not exactly bathed in the light of righteousness right now when it comes to the environment. Despite not having a physical form, they are ultimately responsible for a substantial amount of environmental impact. This has stemmed from news stories detailing how, in Iceland, more electricity is being used to mine Bitcoin than is used to power its homes, or that Bitcoin mining now uses as much energy as all of Ireland consumes. Sensationalist as these headlines might be, there is no denying that Bitcoin, Ethereum and the myriad of minable altcoins are responsible for significant power consumption today.These headlines are why people are more aware of the perceived negative impacts of cryptocurrency mining than they are of the process of mining itself. To grossly oversimplify the process, every 10 minutes a bundle of transactions are encrypted in a block, which is added to the blockchain. Bitcoin miners bundle said transactions into blocks by hashing the transactions together in a Merkle tree, then solving a so-called “proof-of-work” puzzle. This puzzle takes the form of a series of mathematical equations used one after another until the “winning” equation is solved. At this point, the block is verified and added to the blockchain. In return, the miner (or consortium) receive the transaction fees and a predetermined allocation of coins for their efforts.

There is growing interest in blockchain enterprise development options. This is one of the kinds of services offered by more than 60 companies participating in the Hyperledger Vendor Directory.” Google has allegedly held an interest in blockchain technology for years and was the most active investor in blockchain startups and applications between 2012 and 2017, after Japan’s SBI Holdings. According to Behlendorf, the search engine’s interest in Hyperledger is due in part to its latest project entitled “Hyperledger Fabric.” He states that Fabric is a leading enterprise blockchain platform that runs dozens of production enterprise networks across finance, healthcare and supply chain applications.

This gap exists between people who specialize in conventional legal terms and contracts and those who specialize in the technological programming of the blockchain.On a recent episode of The Tatiana Show, host Tatiana Moroz interviewed Hartej Sawhney, president and co-founder of the cybersecurity firm, Hosho. Calling in from the back of a taxi cab in Istanbul, Sawhney explained that Hosho’s business advantage has developed around overcoming the knowledge gap.“We see ourselves as a cybersecurity company that happens to focus on the cryptocurrency/ blockchain space,” said Sawhney. “What we’ve been doing to date has been building up a team of white hat hackers, people who have a strong background in the DevCon community.” For those unfamiliar with DevCon, it is considered to be one of the world’s largest and most well known hacker convention.Headquartered in Las Vegas, Hosho focuses on auditing smart contracts “on any blockchain” and simulating cyber attacks to test the security of different systems.

"                        New York realtors looking to avoid hiccups in their commission payouts can now turn to blockchain-based smart contracts. The first real estate commission split was brokered earlier this summer in Manhattan’s ritzy SoHo neighborhood by New York-based Bapple Realty.Enabled through data uploaded onto the Zap platform, the seller divvied up a $3,400 commission — paid in Ethereum tokens — to pay the brokerage and the agents involved in the transaction.Bapple itself is no stranger to blockchain technology and the use of cryptocurrencies. In 2014, the firm agreed to an $18,000 rent and commissions payment with bitcoin. With the current deal, the infusion of blockchain technology within the real estate industry becomes more solidified. A primary requirement in implementing the blockchain-based transaction included the input of oracles: real world information uploaded into a decentralized application. This is where Zap, founded by Nick Spanos, comes into the picture. Zap.org, a product of the Synapse Foundation, uses an Ethereum-based ERC 20 token (ZAP) to power its oracle marketplace for smart contracts.  The opportunity to expand blockchain technology further into the real estate industry this summer came about as a Zap client and a Nordic Blockchain Association board member was looking to find a Manhattan-area apartment. At the time, Zap was conducting beta testing of its Android app for smart contracts. “We ...",2018-07-12 12:39:46,bitcoinmagazine,Bitcoin|Startups,Nick Spanos’s Zap Jolts Real Estate With Blockchain-Based Smart Contracts

"                        With an estimated $100 billion value in sunken artifacts in the waters surrounding the Bahamas, deep-sea treasure hunters could soon satiate their thirst for a big bounty through blockchain technology.Using an approach that tokenizes shipwrecked items found on the seafloor, the founders behind blockchain startup PO8 intend to revitalize marine archaeology in the region minus the kind of looting, corruption and lack of oversight that caused officials with the commonwealth government to put a halt to expeditions in the region for nearly two decades. PO8’s model in adhering to responsible salvaging practices convinced the local government officials, as Chief Marketing Officer Raul Vasquez told Bitcoin Magazine: “Currently PO8 is the only government approved entity with a salvage license to do any underwater salvaging in territorial waters belonging to the Bahamas.” Using an Ethereum-based platform along with ERC-721 token functionality, the PO8 model creates non-fungible tokens (NFTs) — tokens based on the collateral value of recovered items. Each NFT utilizes specifically designed smart contracts that are cryptographically certified with unique asset data. While NFT ownership can be to anyone in the world, the majority of PO8 artifacts remain in the custody of the PO8 Foundation. “For example, let’s say PO8 finds a rare artifact worth millions,” Vasquez explained. “The physical artifact would remain under...",2018-07-11 20:26:25,bitcoinmagazine,Bitcoin|Digital assets,Deep-Sea Treasure Hunting on the Blockchain

This also allows the platform to create a higher level of liquidity and volume, as well as a diversity of topics not typically covered by traditional prediction markets.Beyond trading, Augur also solves a key problem by moving “real world information” onto Ethereum’s blockchain in a secure manner where results can’t be altered.

"                       The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is examining an application from the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) Global Markets which, if approved, could grant the company a coveted bitcoin ETF license, and bring new waves of institutional investors to the bitcoin arena.The process began in June 2018, when the SEC recently sought comments from industry professionals regarding the ETF in question, which is being offered through the VanEck SolidX Bitcoin Trust – a joint venture between financial firms VanEck and SolidX. The application is the Trust’s third attempt to garner any such license; the first two attempts were rejected in early 2017, upon which the SEC released the following statement:“Based on the record before it, the Commission believes that the significant markets for bitcoin are unregulated. Therefore, the Commission does not find the proposed rule change to be consistent with the Exchange Act.”The cryptocurrency space remains largely unmonitored, and the SEC has sought to take a firm stance to ensure consumer protection and safety. After much debate and speculation, however, officials recently decided that both bitcoin and Ethereum – despite its early pre-sale (now ICO) status – were too decentralized to be considered securities, and could not be regulated by the organization.Regulators of the SEC also announced in late June that they were working on an outline for newer...",2018-07-09 23:38:01,bitcoinmagazine,Bitcoin|Investing,CBOE Files with SEC for Bitcoin ETF

"                          On June 14, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) director of corporate finance made waves in the cryptocurrency space when he commented at Yahoo Finance’s All Market Summit: Crypto that ether is not a security. The statement carries weight.His words led to a flurry of speculation about the potential implications of what this means for Ethereum as well as the larger cryptocurrency ecosystem with regards to development and regulation.It should be noted that the shifting status of regulatory terms can be confusing and contrary to the logic of programming languages that cryptocurrencies use. As a result, Adam B. Levine dedicated much of Episode #371 of his show, Let’s Talk Bitcoin, to clearing up misconceptions about the SEC’s stance. To do this, he invited lawyer and programmer Stephen Palley for an in-depth interview.Discretion in the Legal WorldLevine began by reading an abridged version of the SEC director’s speech, or as he dubbed it, “When Howey Met Gary.” Next, Levine spoke with Palley to hammer out what the speech is stating. In the speech, Director William Henman recalled the 1946 Supreme Court ruling of SEC v.s. W.J. Howey Co., which first laid out the terms for what defines an asset, such as land purchases or services contracts, to be a government regulated by the Securities Act. Under this act, the form of the contract itself is of less importance than the actual economic substan...",2018-06-29 20:16:19,bitcoinmagazine,Bitcoin|Regulation,A Nuanced Look At Crypto Assets as Securities In Light of SEC Comments

A new $300 million crypto fund was launched by Andreessen Horowitz to help grow the ecosystem, and Coinbase’s CEO started a cryptocurrency charity fund that already has $1 million to work with.

"                        Technologist and Apple Inc. co-founder Steve Wozniak played contrarian at the NEX technology conference in late June, comparing the hype around blockchain to the fervor he witnessed just before the implosion of the dot-com bubble. Still, Wozniak stood by his unflinching loyalty for Bitcoin, even in the midst of the market’s 2018 downturn.To be sure, Wozniak believes blockchain technology will serve as a cornerstone for business and industry in the future, calling it “decentralized and totally trustworthy.”Nonetheless, early adopters “can burn themselves out by not being prepared to be stable in the long run,” Wozniak said. Comparing the growth of the blockchain industry to the dot-com mania of yesteryear, he said, “It was a bubble, and I feel that way about blockchain.”It’s Wozniak’s guess that the same pattern will repeat today. “If you look now you say all that internet stuff happened, we got it, it just took a while,” he told the tech conference audience.Ultimately, Wozniak forecasts that blockchain technology will disrupt the social media sector. Facebook, which holds somewhat of a social media monopoly, is ripe for competition, and a blockchain-based platform could emerge as a key rival to challenge the status quo.Wozniak also sees long-term potential in Ethereum and its currency, ether. In particular, Wozniak cited programmers’ ability to build out their own Ethereum-based projects, as well as dev...",2018-06-29 17:29:08,bitcoinmagazine,Bitcoin|Digital assets,"Blockchain Hype Overstates Reality, Says Steve Wozniak"

"                        The SEC’s proclamation that ether (ETH) is not a security has sparked some celebration amongst the cryptocurrency community. Regulatory clarity is always a good thing, but ICO operators shouldn’t see this as a reason to put the champagne on ice.The fact is, ICOs are still better off operating as if they were securities. Even if the case can be made that you’re a utility token, there are still an array of external factors that can upend your legitimacy. Though following the path of least regulatory resistance is more tempting than ever, taking the steps to be overseen as a security, which includes proactive engagement with regulatory bodies, is the wiser move, both for the stability of your business and the viability of the cryptocurrency space.Before we dive into the reasons why, let’s make one thing clear: the SEC’s view on ETH is correct. It is more akin to a commodity like oil than it is a security. That said, the SEC’s announcement has its flip side: further clarity on what can be considered a security. While the SEC’s reasoning behind why ETH is a utility can still be loosely interpreted, their instruction for security tokens to register with them is pretty clear-cut.This brings us to the first reason why going the utility route is less than ideal: regulatory flux. To put it differently, regulators can change their minds.

"                        Witek Radomski — co-founder and CTO of Enjin Coin — has developed ERC-1155, a new standard for defining video game tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. Radomski’s journey to improve the gaming experience began 12 months ago in June 2017, when he created code for the first non-fungible token. It was released on GitHub two months later, and it led to the creation of the ERC-721 token, which is widely considered the standard for blockchain-based gaming and digital art. Several decentralized applications (DApps) have implemented the ERC-721 onto their platforms to create a wide array of gaming collectibles. Unfortunately, ERC-721 was found to exhibit several limitations, and Radomski knew he had to take the standard to the next level.“The non-fungible tokens being used today have defined a new class of user-owned virtual items,” he explained. “However, there are many problems with the existing token model. It is very expensive and inefficient to deploy large databases of items that mainstream game developers use.” Radomski explains in a blog post that the new ERC-1155 protocol allows for an infinite number of both fungible and non-fungible items to be deployed through a single contract. It is also lightweight and easy for most networks to handle.“If this does take off, the gaming industry alone will require tens of millions of new items — but the application of this standard is by no means limited to the game...",2018-06-25 21:25:07,bitcoinmagazine,Bitcoin|Ethereum,"Enjin Coin CTO Creates ERC-1155, a New Token Standard for Ethereum"

Typically, these accounts masquerade as the blockchain industry’s high-profile individuals.

"                        Jeff Garzik first tuned the world into his latest venture in the fall of 2017. The Bloq co-founder unveiled Metronome (MET), a cryptocurrency he founded alongside Matthew Roszak, at the Las Vegas Money 20/20 conference in late October, and the project caught the attention of Bloomberg and Fortune at the time.What makes Metronome interesting is that it promises its users cross-chain portability. It also purports to offer a consistent rate of inflation and “no undue influence from founders after launch.” These three promises — Metronome’s mantra of self-governance, reliability and portability — set lofty expectations for the new company; anyone acquainted with Bitcoin and blockchain technology is likely to watch and see if it can deliver.Garzik has stated in past interviews that he created Metronome as a new beginning, a project that embodies what he would do differently after building on Bitcoin for a number of years. Metronome’s differences seem to suggest that the search for hyper-decentralization was Garzik’s touchstone for starting over. Imagine a coin being so intrinsically opposed to centralization, for instance, that it isn’t beholden to a single blockchain.Of course, as an ERC20 token, it is fundamentally tied to Ethereum; but the team claims that via smart contracts, users can swap the coin from chain to chain.

It was, at the time, the largest crowdfunded project ever created. On June 18, 2016, hackers successfully exploited a weakness in the splitting function of the protocol that allowed for the extraction of ether from multiple DAO smart contracts while utilizing the same DAO tokens. The end result was a theft of 3.6 million ether that was worth roughly $70 million.Debate arose within the Ethereum community regarding a proper response to the attack. After a failed soft fork, a vote in July concluded that a hard fork would be instituted to erase the DAO hack by placing the compromised ETH in a new smart contract that would then be used to redistribute the funds to their original owners.

"                        Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak has some very positive things to say about bitcoin. In a recent interview with CNBC, the computer mogul admitted that he hopes bitcoin will become a single global currency and that he shares the sentiment of Twitter and Square CEO Jack Dorsey, who expressed his belief last March that bitcoin will become a unifying cryptocurrency for every nation within the next 10 years.“I buy into what Jack Dorsey says,” he explained, “not that I necessarily believe it’s going to happen, but because I want it to be that way.” Wozniak first bought bitcoin when it was priced at $700, roughly $6,700 less than where it currently stands. He has since sold almost his entire stash but for one coin, admitting that he never wanted to be an investor but was only intrigued by how the cryptocurrency worked. He also owns two ether (the cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain platform), which he has been very complimentary toward. At a recent conference in Vienna, Wozniak praised Ethereum and said it had the potential to become “the new Apple.” “Ethereum interests me because it can do things and because it’s a platform,” he affirmed.

"                        Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has taken another step toward trading ERC20 tokens by acquiring decentralized relayer Paradex. ERC20 is the Ethereum technical standard that the majority of initial coin offering (ICO) tokens are based on.Paradex announced the news on its website today, May 23, 2018, adding that its site will be down temporarily while it works to make the integrations with Coinbase.   Paradex bills itself as a decentralized exchange (DEX), meaning no third party is involved in holding the funds. Instead, users can use the platform to trade ERC20 tokens directly wallet to wallet. Paradex is built on top of the 0x (pronounced “zero x”) protocol.  Right now, Coinbase trades four coins: bitcoin (BTC), bitcoin cash (BCH), ether (ETH) and litecoin (LTC). Adding ERC20 tokens could significantly boost the number of digital assets it carries. Due to the ICO boom that has taken place over the last few years, thousands of different ICO tokens are now available.  But because U.S. regulators are in the midst of clarifying their stance on virtual currencies, many exchanges are holding back from listing ICO tokens. In March 2018, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a clear warning to virtual currency exchanges that some ICO tokens may qualify as noncompliant securities, and any exchange that lists security tokens needs to either register as a national securities exchange or operate...",2018-05-23 23:51:44,bitcoinmagazine,Bitcoin|Digital assets,Coinbase Takes Another Step Toward Trading ICO Tokens by Acquiring Paradex

This was followed by an announcement of partnerships with Nokia and OSIsoft.The Streamr Marketplace connects data producers and consumers through a web-based application where data consumers can pay for access to real-time data streams listed by data providers.

The use of the Streamr cryptographic token, DATA, will make it possible for data streams around the world to be freely tradable. The terms of use, pricing schedules and more are currently coded in Ethereum smart contracts, though Streamr has plans to support additional networks.

"                        As chairman of the board of the Nighthawk Group, an international barter and trade organization involved in other luxury assets, James Bolin possesses a deep knowledge of global markets and commerce. Operating in several countries, Nighthawk and its partners has amassed a global presence that holds major strategic influence on the world monetary stage. Possessing both a wide knowledge of finance and an even deeper historical view of money, Bolin sees life and progress as predicated by innovation and calculated risk. He believes that our world is facing an unprecedented period of global wealth transfer that will have profound implications for the future of money. This trend, said Bolin, has led him on an ambitious quest to create a trade dollar of value that is cash convertible. The Blockchain is the technological mechanism that he thinks can deliver on this promise. In partnership with New York entrepreneur Dean Anastos, Bolin created the kryptonite trade coin (KTC), an asset based digital currency. Kryptonite’s value is to act as a “gateway” currency allowing holders to buy or trade assets or services worldwide. Using smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, kryptonite will allow users to employ encrypted wallets for highly secure transaction between parties. Anastos, founder and CEO of BlockchainDevelopers.org, is working with Bolin to weave together the critical infrastructure necessary to make th...",2018-05-08 18:08:14,bitcoinmagazine,Bitcoin,Promoted:  Kryptonite Sparks The Future of Wealth and Global Trade

Since the first week of March, the platform’s Steemit account, EOS Go, has posted weekly reports on the organizations that have submitted themselves for consideration.A mixture of big and little fish, the candidate pool includes upward of 50 different organizations. Some are groups of regional enthusiasts that bear the EOS name next to their home country or city, such as EOS Detroit, EOS Rio and EOS Canada.

"                        Ether is the underlying token powering the Ethereum blockchain, but it serves a slightly different purpose than bitcoin does to the Bitcoin blockchain. Although ether is traded on public markets and has displayed price appreciation similar to bitcoin, they are quite different by design. Ether is not intended to be a unit of currency on a peer-to-peer payment network; rather, it acts as the “fuel” or “gas” that powers the Ethereum network.At the highest level, Ethereum is an open-source platform that runs smart contracts. When smart contracts are run on a blockchain, they become self-executing when certain conditions are met. The execution of smart contracts requires computational resources that must be paid for in some way: this is where ether comes in.  Ether is the crypto-fuel allowing smart contracts to run. It provides the incentive for nodes to validate blocks on the Ethereum blockchain, which contains the smart contract code. Every time a block is validated, 5 ethers are created and awarded to the successful node. A new block is propagated roughly every 15–17 seconds. Some nodes may find the correct solution to a block without having it included in the network. The Ethereum network rewards these nodes with 2–3 ethers.Individuals interacting with decentralized applications on the Ethereum platform will have to pay the network in ether for the use. Developers are incentivized to create these decentr...",2018-04-16 20:59:14,bitcoinmagazine,Bitcoin|Ethereum,What Is Ether?

From being one of the first crowdfunded projects, way past the challenges we had to face while navigating the uncharted territory that is building Golem, the time has come to take the big step: mainnet launch is here,” the project wrote. Initially advertised as an “Airbnb” for computers, the idea behind Golem is to create a global market for your idle computing power. You can rent out your unused computing power and you will be paid for it in cryptocurrency — in this case, the Golem Network tokens (GNT). Ultimately, the goal for Golem is to make just about anything that requires heavy computer lifting — think computer generated images (CGI) rendering, scientific calculation, machine learning and more — both affordable and accessible.

"                        The battle over who was at fault when millions of nano (XRB) vanished from an Italian cryptocurrency exchange earlier this year rages on. In the latest twist to the story, the Nano Foundation is launching a legal fund to support the victims and says it will match up to $1 million in donations.Stepping back, in February 2018, 17 million XRB, worth $170 million at the time, went missing from BitGrail, rendering the exchange insolvent. Accusations and speculation followed. BitGrail owner Francesco Firano (better known by his pseudonym “the Bomber” on social media) insisted the problem stemmed from a bug in Nano, while the Nano team pointed their fingers at BitGrail. Meanwhile, the victims of the breach were left to wonder whether this was a planned exit scam or an outside hack.LawsuitSome of the victims placed the blame on Nano, and on April 6, 2018, a class action lawsuit was filed, charging Nano (formerly RaiBlocks) and its core team members with selling securities and alleging that the team encouraged investors to open accounts on the distressed and unknown BitGrail exchange. The class action is also seeking a court ordered “rescue fork” to return funds lost in the hack.  Now, in what appears to be a direct response to the lawsuit, the Nano Foundation announced on a Medium post on April 9, 2018, a fund to support the victims of the breach in their legal efforts to reclaim those funds. “We felt it was im...",2018-04-10 14:13:31,bitcoinmagazine,Bitcoin|Law & justice,Nano to Match $1M in Legal Fund Donations to Support BitGrail Hack Victims

"                        One hard fork later, there are four new Monero projects.Monero hard forked to version 12 of its protocol yesterday. But not everyone is on board. Following the example once set by Ethereum Classic, some users are continuing on the pre-hard fork Monero blockchain… though in this case not as a single project. Now there is  Monero Classic, Monero 0 (XMZ), Monero Original (XMO) and a second project by the name Monero Classic (XMC) (which in this article we will refer to as Monero-Classic); these are all continuing on version 11 of the Monero protocol. Of course, this means they are all still compatible on a single network, using the same asset (coin) — just with different names.Here’s the story of the pre-hard fork Monero blockchain and the four different projects keeping it alive.The Hard ForkAs an ongoing protocol upgrade process, Monero has made a habit of hard forking once every six months. The latest hard fork introduced several new features, including an increased ring-size for more private but also bigger (thus more resource-intensive) transactions, multi-signature transactions, initial Ledger Nano S hardware wallet support, and more.The latest hard fork also introduced a tweak to Monero’s CryptoNight proof-of-work hashing algorithm.

One source claims that searches relating to bitcoin and cryptocurrency have slumped by 80 percent since last October. In addition, it says that searches in Japan and South Korea — two of the world’s largest bitcoin havens — have fallen to their lowest levels since March of 2017.Looking at a recent Google chart, one can see that amongst the three top cryptocurrencies — bitcoin, ether and litecoin — bitcoin is the only one that remains a “global trend.” Ethereum still boasts interest in certain parts of Asia and Eastern Europe, but Litecoin doesn’t appear anywhere.Source: Google TrendsAnother source dated in January 2018 discusses search patterns of the previous three months, and suggests that general interest in crypto has dropped so significantly, the price could ultimately hit $7,100.This was an understatement compared to what really occurred. Back in February, the price of bitcoin briefly fell below $6,000 in what was considered a new low following “Red Tuesday” and the recent sell-off that had taken place.

"                        On March 20, 2018, it was revealed that a bug hidden in Coinbase’s Ethereum smart contract setup could have given users access to unlimited amounts of ether. At press time, it does not appear as though the vulnerability was ever exploited or even noticed by users.The issue was first discovered last December by VI Company, a Dutch firm that specializes in fintech. The company was planning to give its employees ether bonuses in celebration of the upcoming holiday season when researchers noticed the issue with their “ETH receiving code” while garnering funds from a contract. They saw that by using a smart contract, a series of digital wallets could be “tricked” into recording ether transfers and purchases that had never actually happened.The team issued the following statement in a vulnerability report later published on the firm’s HackerOne account in January 2018:“By using a smart contract to distribute [ETH] over a set of wallets, you can manipulate the account balance of your Coinbase account. If [one] wallet transaction in the smart contract fails, all transactions before that will be reversed, but on Coinbase, these transactions will not be reversed, meaning a person could add as much Ethereum to their balance as they want.”The report specified the following steps for taking advantage of the exchange’s weakness:Set up a smart contract with a few valid Coinbase wallets and [one] final faulty wallet.Tr...",2018-03-22 22:35:38,bitcoinmagazine,Bitcoin|Technical,Bug Caught That Allowed Coinbase Users to Garner Unlimited Amounts of Ether

"  Proof of Work (PoW) mining operations, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, use a tremendous amount of energy and generate a tremendous amount of waste heat. Qarnot is one of a number of growing companies that has found a way to turn that waste heat into controlled heating for the home or office.The new Qarnot QC-1 ""crypto heater"" takes advantage of an obvious synergy: It makes use of the waste heat generated by mining crypto in the guise of an attractive space heater. Spec wise, the QC-1 contains two GPUs: NITRO+ RADEON RX 580 8G 60 MH/s at 650W. Local electrical costs and climate are key determining factors with regard to recouping costs and making a profit; for example, if you are in a cold northern environment with cheap electricity like Quebec, then your costs to run it should be low enough (about $0.03 KWh USD) that the mining revenue should pay for the device in a few years.The device mines Ethereum by default but can be configured to mine various other PoW-based cryptocurrencies such as Litecoin. A mobile app is available to monitor your account and configure the unit. The lack of fans or hard drives leads Qarnot to claim the system is “perfectly noiseless.” Over the years, there has been increasing concern over centralized mining and the diminishing ability of individuals to be able to mine successfully. While they are certainly efficient, centralized PoW mining centers compromise key features such as censorship resistance.

"  One of the most promising concepts of second-generation blockchains is that of dApps (or “decentralised applications”). These are apps built on top of a blockchain. To date, few have made the headlines (with the exception, perhaps, of CryptoKitties), but there is a an increasingly large amount being pushed to the Ethereum mainnet, and even more in the works — State of the Dapps lists a range of projects in various stages of development. MetaMask will let users interact with these dApps using only their browser. Bitcoin Magazine spoke with James Moreau from the MetaMask team to get a grasp of how their platform grants access to the growing ecosystem of games and applications on the Ethereum blockchain.“MetaMask reduces one of the major headaches of using dApps,” Moreau said. “That is, running a full Ethereum node. Before MetaMask’s arrival on the scene in 2016, users would need to use a client such as Mist to interface with the blockchain.

Users are able to generate multiple accounts, in which they can store Ether and ERC20-compli...",2018-03-09 17:36:55,bitcoinmagazine,Bitcoin,MetaMask Lets You Visit Tomorrow’s Distributed Web in Today’s Browser

"  An eclipse attack is a network-level attack on a blockchain, where an attacker essentially takes control of the peer-to-peer network, obscuring a node’s view of the blockchain.In a new paper titled “Low-Resource Eclipse Attacks on Ethereum’s Peer-to-Peer Network,” Sharon Goldberg, an associate professor at Boston University; Ethan Heilman, a Ph.D. candidate at Boston University; and Yuval Marcus, a researcher at the University of Pittsburgh, describe a way to carry out an eclipse attack on the Ethereum network. (The researchers disclosed their attacks to Ethereum on January 9, 2018, and Ethereum developers have already issued a patch — Geth v1.8.1 — to fix the network.)  In speaking with Bitcoin Magazine, Goldberg explained the research, how it compares to Bitcoin eclipse attacks and why she thinks the work is important. First, she emphasized that working with Ethereum developers to fix the vulnerability was a smooth process. “It was a very functional, easy disclosure,” she said.  In an email to Bitcoin Magazine, Martin Holst Swende, security lead at Ethereum Foundation — the nonprofit that oversees the development of Ethereum — explained that the recent Geth patch contains several modifications to the peer-to-peer layer and does not affect consensus-critical code.

"  Ethereum has just announced its Ethereum Community Fund (ECF) grant program, an initiative launched by a collection of major players in the Ethereum world that is designed to accelerate the development of blockchain infrastructure apps and services. The stated aim of the ECF is to bring about “an environment where teams and ideas can thrive, grow, and collaborate to become essential and functioning pieces of the broader Ethereum ecosystem.”All of this raises the question of what exactly we mean when we talk about “blockchain ecosystems” and how they are built. Well, here’s an analogy for you: blockchains are like roads.Just as there’s no single type of road (regular highways, motorways, backcountry dirt tracks), there is no single type of blockchain. Each one is purpose-built for its own ends. Not only that, but roads have a system of independent elements that come together to enable the whole ecosystem to function smoothly and reliably: traffic lights, police enforcers, toll roads, gas stations and so on. So it is with blockchains.When we talk about a “blockchain ecosystem,” we’re talking about the parts that constitute the whole, how they interact with each other and how they interact with the outside world. The Bitcoin ecosystem, for example, boils down to four parts: the users sending and receiving payments, the miners generating the cryptocurrency, the investors buying it, and the developers that monitor and maintain th...",2018-02-26 19:49:30,bitcoinmagazine,Bitcoin|Blockchain|Op-ed,Op Ed: What Do We Mean When We Talk About the ‘Blockchain Ecosystem”?
