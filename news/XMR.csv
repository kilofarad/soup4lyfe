"                        After the recent hard fork upgrade of its protocol, Monero has seen its transaction fees shrink by approximately 97 percent, dropping from 60 cents to just 2 cents. Crypto analytics firm Coinmetrics shared a tweet confirming the drop in fees and their corresponding reduction in transaction size, falling from 18.5kb pre-fork to 3kb — an 80 percent change.The upgrade, called “Monero 0.13.0 Beryllium Bullet,” implements ""bulletproofs.” First introduced by researchers at Stanford, the cryptographic scheme shrinks the size and cost of transactions specifically for Confidential Transactions.  Why Bulletproofs?As stated above, Bulletproofs are a scaling complement to Monero’s Ring Confidential Transactions (RingCT), Monero's main privacy feature, which uses a combination of ring signatures and Confidential Transactions. Ring signatures are cryptographic digital signatures that protect a user's privacy in the input side of a transaction by making it nearly impossible to determine who the actual signer of a transaction is. To achieve this privacy, each Monero transaction includes additional, extraneous coins (decoys) to mask the exact coin being signed, making it extremely difficult to parse the real coins being sent from the decoys. Before the upgrade, six decoys were added to each Monero transaction--now, ten will be featured in each. Bolstering the privacy provided by ring signatures, Confidential Transaction...",2018-10-22T19:09:33,bitcoinmagazine,Bitcoin|Privacy & security,Monero Transaction Fees Reduced by 97% After Bulletproofs Upgrade

"                        Computer users now have one more thing to worry about: cybercriminals secretly taping into your CPU or GPU to mine cryptocurrencies. Due to an ability to access your computer via a web browser, “cryptojacking” is on the rise, cautioned a British government agency.“The technique of delivering cryptocurrency miners through malware has been used for several years, but it is likely in 2018-19 that one of the main threats will be a newer technique of mining cryptocurrency which exploits visitors to a website,” the UK’s National Cyber Security Centrehttps://www.ncsc.gov.uk/ (NCSC) wrote in its annual report on April 10, 2018.Some HistoryWhile other types of malware have to find a way to trick you into downloading software, in-browser cryptojacking malware doesn’t require you to install a program. Instead, hackers infect a website or an online ad with JavaScript code that auto-executes once it loads in your browser. The cryptomining code then does its job in the background while you continue using your computer as normal. A lag in performance may be the only clue that a computer has been compromised.  Cryptojacking took off in September 2017 when Coinhive published a JavaScript miner that could start mining the ASIC-resistant cryptocurrency Monero (XMR) after a webpage loaded. “Your users run the miner directly in their browser and mine XMR for you in turn for an ad-free experience, in-game currency or whateve...",2018-04-11T13:15:10,bitcoinmagazine,Bitcoin|Scams,Computer Users Face Growing Threat from Cryptojacking — Report
