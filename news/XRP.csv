Pointing to recent failings of social media sites Facebook and hinting that far better privacy options are around the corner, he stated: “The cat is out of the bag.” In a fireside chat with Charlie Lee, founder of Litecoin, a cryptocurrency based on Bitcoin’s code, Chaum spoke broadly about the future of digital privacy. He also took the opportunity to promote his latest venture: a blockchain-based payment and messaging system dubbed “Elixxir,” which Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen is backing. David Bailey, CEO of BTC Media, moderated the talk. People are more conscience of privacy because the scope of privacy has changed, Chaum said. In the past, the focus was on how to shield personal information; now the concern is more around the vast accumulation of metadata. “People are more aware of the dangers of being tracked,” he said. Switching the topic to his own project, the father of online anonymity, who is known for his ambitious projects in the past, boasted that Elixxir is capable of processing hundr...",2018-10-24 15:02:40,bitcoinmagazine,Bitcoin|Events,David Chaum on Digital Privacy: “The Cat Is Out of the Bag”

Of the stolen money, $58 million came from exchanges, while the remaining $22 million was taken from individual crypto wallets.During this time period, there were 158 instances of theft — triple the number for the same period last year.

The terms of the settlement, however, are being kept under wraps by both parties.The legal proceedings date back to July of 2017 when R3 accused Ripple and Brad Garlinghouse of breaching an agreement that would allow R3 to purchase 5 billion XRP, Ripple’s native currency, at a rate of $0.0085 before September 2019. By the time the court proceedings came to light, XRP was trading at $0.26. After the Delaware Chancery Court threw the case out, the suit continued in the California State Supreme court when Ripple filed a countersuit against R3 to dismiss the suit. After this case was thrown out, as well, the case was moved to New York.In the ongoing case’s latest filing, Ripple claimed, “R3 breached separate and distinct promises it made to Ripple and XRP II.” This included withholding information that financial institutions J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley would be leaving R3’s consortium during the terms of the agreement, these banks being integral to Ripple’s adoption, the company claimed.Seeing as R3 failed to “assist Ripple [in signing] up a single bank,” the countersuit sought to nullify the original agreement and award Ri...",2018-09-11 18:26:19,bitcoinmagazine,Bitcoin|Law & justice,Ripple and R3 Reach Settlement in Year-Long Court Case

"                        IBM has launched a blockchain-based payment system called Blockchain World Wire. According to IBM, the new payment network uses digital currency on Stellar's blockchain to ""clear and settle cross-border payments"" in near real time.The Stellar network is a distributed, blockchain-based ledger that facilitates cross-asset transfers of value. Like Ripple, Stellar can handle exchanges between fiat-based currencies and digital assets. Using this protocol, IBM wants to make it possible for financial institutions to move money quickly and reliably, while cutting off intermediaries and complexities associated with traditional international payment systems.Speaking with Bitcoin Magazine, Jed McCaleb, co-founder of the Stellar Development Foundation, said, “IBM's implementation of the Stellar protocol has the potential to change the way money is moved around the world, helping to drastically improve international transactions and advancing financial inclusion in developing nations.""To use the new payment system, two financial institutions have to agree on the currency — a stablecoin or any digital asset — to be used as a bridge asset between any two fiat currencies. The companies will use their existing payment system, connected to World Wire's API, to convert the first fiat into a digital asset. World Wire will then convert the digital asset into the second fiat currency simultaneously, completing the transactio...",2018-09-05 20:49:17,bitcoinmagazine,Bitcoin|Payments,IBM Introduces 'World Wire' Payment System on Stellar Network
