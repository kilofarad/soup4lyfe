"                        Charles Hoskinson is best known today as a co-founder of both Ethereum and IOHK, where he leads the research, design and development of Cardano. But before these projects, there was Bitcoin. Back in 2013, he was the founding chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation’s education committee and established the Cryptocurrency Research Group.In an interview with Bitcoin Magazine during the recent StartEngine Summit, Hoskinson began by saying that he views Bitcoin as a series of experiments to try and realize two key concepts:“Can we achieve a decentralized form of value transfer or some sort of proto-money, and, instead of having a central entity issuing a token and securing it, can we release something decentralized with a secure ledger? And, if that happens, will it achieve real value in the marketplace?” In the early days, said Hoskinson, it wasn’t clear if this thing was going to survive or not. “It actually took several years for that to turn into the bitcoin we know and love,” he said. “It had huge volatility in price. The volume would be $1,000 a day, the hashrate would go way up and way down. Some people would say, ‘Eh, I don’t wanna mine anymore.’ They’d turn their computer off, and the network would lose 30 percent of its hashrate.” But the sea of change for Bitcoin took place in 2013. “As the market cap hit one billion, people started taking it really seriously.

"                        On October 29, 2018, the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) announced in Prague at DevCon 4 two new software specifications that will help businesses standardize future code developments on an enterprise version of the Ethereum blockchain.The first specification, Client Specification V2, defines the implementation requirements for Enterprise Ethereum clients, including interfaces to the external-facing components of Enterprise Ethereum and how they are intended to be used. The standardization of performance, permissioning and privacy demands of enterprise deployments are viewed as a necessary step by the EEA in order to help the growing number of vendors developing Ethereum clients to ensure that different clients can communicate with each other and all reliably work on an enterprise Ethereum network. EEA Executive Director Ron Resnick stated that “using the EEA Specification, Ethereum developers can write code that enables interoperability, thus motivating enterprise customers to select EEA specification-based solutions over proprietary offerings”.

Aside from digital currency, enterprise or platform tokenization remains a hotbed for blockchain-based startups, with the vast majority of those needing an ecosystem where ...",2018-10-30 19:19:20,bitcoinmagazine,Bitcoin|Ethereum,Standardized Specifications for Enterprise Version of Ethereum Announced

"                        Cardano, the platform underpinning ADA, the ninth largest cryptocurrency by market cap, is opening its doors to third-party developers through a new client, written in systems programing language Rust.“As a project matures and grows, you need to satisfy the demands of different clients,” Charles Hoskinson, CEO at IOHK, the blockchain development company behind Cardano, told Bitcoin Magazine.  IOHK made the announcement on October 1, 2018, exactly one year after it launched Byron, the first version of Cardano’s settlement layer, which was built in the functional programming language Haskell. While Haskell works well for mission-critical code, Rust shines in areas like mobile, where performance matters. Rust was created by Mozilla for Firefox as a replacement for C++. It is worth noting that Cardano, a proof-of-stake blockchain, is currently centralized with all of its blocks being produced by IOHK. But the project hopes to change that in Q1 2019 when its Shelley release opens up staking pools to users. (Shelley was originally slated for Q2 2018.) At its core, Cardano’s Rust project is a software development kit for the Cardano blockchain. It has several ingredients needed to interact with the blockchain, including data types like blocks, transactions and addresses, along with protocol functions to query blocks, send transactions and so on.

"                        This month, we celebrate Ethereum’s third birthday and reflect upon the many milestones that have occured in the industry since the dawn of the original smart contract blockchain. Mainstream interest is burgeoning, market capitalization for the industry has increased by over 5,900 percent, and the number of cryptocurrencies currently in circulation is at an all-time high. Up until recently, it seemed as if Ethereum would be one of the only platforms capable of fostering the mainstream adoption of blockchain technology. That is, until Cardano (ADA) appeared.While admittedly in its early stages, Cardano is already being labeled by some experts as a scalable solution to several of the inefficiencies created by Ethereum, which, some say, seems to be suffering from its own success. In recent months, the platform has been inundated with a slew of new decentralized applications (DApps) that are creating a bottleneck effect on the Ethereum blockchain. As famously portrayed by the meteoric rise of blockchain craze CryptoKitties, popular Ethereum applications require excessive bandwidth to remain afloat, which ultimately has a detrimental effect on network efficiency. And although ether’s hashrate is growing, it’s being far outpaced by the sheer number of projects being built on the blockchain.By contrast, Cardano has been specifically designed to handle high-volume transactions, operating on a first-of-its-kind ...",2018-08-14 18:53:10,bitcoinmagazine,Bitcoin|Op-ed,Op Ed: Evaluating the Promise of Cardano: Has Ethereum Met Its Match?
