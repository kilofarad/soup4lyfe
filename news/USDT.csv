"                        Fresh on the market, the industry’s newest batch of stablecoins is having trouble striking a price balance.Amidst news of listings on Huobi and OKEx, two of the industry’s largest exchanges, TrueUSD (TUSD), Gemini USD (GUSD), the Paxos Standard (PAX) and Circle’s USD Coin (USDC) have all risen well above their pegs. Following the fiat-collateralized model pioneered by Tether (USDT), these stablecoins are meant to retain a stable $1 value, keeping their peg by backing each on-chain token with a dollar in their bank accounts.On October 15, 2018, OKEx announced its immediate support of the four previously mentioned stablecoins, putting them in the company of tether, previously the platform’s only stable asset. Huobi, which also supports tether, followed suit the next day, announcing that it would open deposits for the four on October 19, 2018, with trading support to be announced at a later date.On the same day as its OKEx listing, TUSD, the oldest and most established of the newcomers, rose to a high of $1.10. Settling down a bit, the coin has fallen since, but, at $1.03, it hasn’t completely stabilized. Currently trading at $1.02, PAX mimicked TUSD’s price movements down to the cent, jumping to $1.10 on October 15, as well.

However, the effects of the rumors did not go unnoticed.Tether, a stablecoin and dollar-backed token, began to stack up a sizable premium from its normal 1:1, dollar-to-tether market rate. This deviation in price began to run massive premiums between Bitfinex and other large crypto exchanges. At one point, the price of bitcoin on Bitfinex hit a high of $7,800 while barely breaking $6,700 on most other exchanges. At the time of this article, the premium, although still modest, has closed significantly.

"                        Stablecoins have garnered serious investor attention over the past few weeks. Unlike bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies, they are digital assets built to lessen price volatility and are often paired against the U.S. dollar or established commodities like gold. Volatility is one of the main reasons why several institutional investors and individuals have thought twice about stepping into the cryptocurrency arena, and stablecoins seek to make things a little less frightening.Cryptocurrency firm blockchain.comhttps://www.blockchain.com/research has released a report examining the growth of the stablecoin trend, the differences between the growing number of stablecoins in circulation, and whether they truly work to lower volatility in the market.In total, 57 stablecoins were examined, including Tether, TrueUSD, Dai and Digix Gold Token. About 26 of these stablecoins — roughly 45 percent — are live, while the remainder are in pre-launch phases. The number of active stablecoin projects has increased heavily over the past 12 to 18 months, and more than a dozen separate ventures have issued plans to launch new stablecoins by the end of the year.The report states that most stablecoins can be separated into two categories: asset-backed and algorithmic (coins that have implemented a central banking platform to keep prices sturdy).

"                        Following an earlier report by researchers from the University of Texas alleging that stablecoin Tether (USDT) issues new tokens to manipulate the bitcoin price, a new report has emerged debunking this theory.Written by Dr. Wang Chun Wei of the University of Queensland Business School, the report states that, contrary to the conclusion of the earlier study by John Griffin and Amin Shams, the effect of Tether is statistically insignificant as far as bitcoin pricing is concerned. Lack of Supporting EvidenceAccording to Wei's report, which uses VAR analysis — a model used to discover meaningful relationships between variables over a period — no evidence was found to suggest the influence of tether in bitcoin’s record-breaking price spike in December 2017. Wei concludes that Tether does not have the market heft required to shift bitcoin one way or the other. Explaining this in detail the report says:“We find no empirical evidence supporting the notion that Tether grants cause subsequent Bitcoin returns to rise on a daily basis. In fact, when we examine the Bitcoin return equation of our VAR model, none of the lagged variables, impacts Bitcoin returns.

"                        University of Berkeley Professor Barry Eichengreen has taken a swipe at the viability of stablecoins in an op-ed published on Project Syndicate. The critique, entitled “The Stable-Coin Myth,” argues stablecoins are not automatically ""viable"" just because they are pegged to an asset, though Eichengreen does believe they have an advantage over ""conventional cryptocurrencies"" such as bitcoin which he says ""is highly unstable"" and ""unattractive as units of account.""“Stable coins purport to solve these problems. Because their value is stable in terms of dollars or their equivalent, they are attractive as units of account and stores of value. They are not mere vehicles for financial speculation. But this doesn’t mean that they are viable,"" he writes.Stablecoins are digital tokens intended to retain a stable value, usually one pegged to a traditional currency like the dollar or euro. Typically, they are backed by a fiat currency or other assets, though this is not always the case. Citing Tether (USDT) in its U.S. context, Eichengreen believes that fully collateralized stablecoins won’t gain traction because it would mean trading in a currency that is “supported by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, for a cryptocurrency with questionable backing that is awkward to use.” To him, “it is not obvious that the model will scale, or that governments will let it.”Since its launch in 2014, USDT has been t...",2018-09-13 15:07:45,bitcoinmagazine,Bitcoin|Digital assets,Berkeley Professor Questions Stablecoin Viability in Unflattering Op-Ed

"                        There is substantial controversy surrounding Tether, a cryptocurrency that claims to be pegged to the U.S. dollar. According to Tether, each Tether token is backed by one U.S. dollar, held in the full reserve of Tether. But the existence of the U.S. dollars pegging Tether has been called into question. Moreover, worries exist that Bitfinex has been using Tether to the prop up the price of Bitcoin.Research into Tether shows that misconceptions exist regarding how Tether functions. These misconceptions, in turn, may be contributing in part to the existing controversies. By better understanding how Tether functions, it may be possible to provide some clarity. Analysis of how Tether functions, for example, shows that it is not possible to prop up the price of Bitcoin on Bitfinex through Tether — regardless of whether or not these tokens are backed. Tether and BitfinexWhereas most cryptocurrencies have a finite supply of tokens, Tether does not. According to Tether’s white paper, new Tether tokens can be issued when customers buy tokens by depositing the underlying fiat currency — U.S. dollars or Euros — in Tether’s bank account. However, it is not currently possible to register at Tether; in fact, registrations have been closed since December 2017. During this time, the amount of Tether tokens more than doubled, peaking at 2.5 billion tokens at the time of writing.For Tether to function as a so-called stabl...",2018-06-14 19:01:14,bitcoinmagazine,Bitcoin|Investing|Digital assets,Clearing Up Misconceptions: This Is How Tether Should (and Does) Work

"                        Bittrex, a U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange, has issued a trading pair between tether (USDT) and TrueUSD (TUSD), two stable tokens pegged to the U.S. dollar. While tether is issued by Tether, TrueUSD is issued by TrustToken.Unlike other cryptocurrencies, stable tokens are pegged to the value of traditional money. In this case, tether and TrueUSD are both pegged to the U.S. dollar, so that one token is worth one dollar.  Stable tokens are useful in that they protect traders from market volatility. The question is, why would one exchange offer two types of dollar tokens? The answer is, it would allow traders who are worried about the long-term viability of one token over the other to hedge their bets by owning one or the other or a little of both. By a similar logic, listing two tokens could also protect the exchanges, particularly those like Bittrex, that do not carry crypto-fiat pairs and depend on stable tokens to maintain liquidity. Tether vs. TrueUSD: A Brief ComparisonTether is closely linked to the cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex, and questions still linger around whether the $2.3 billion in tether issued so far are backed by actual dollars. So far, no third-party audit has taken place to prove that is the case, and Bitfinex has been opaque about its banking relationships.Also, because the identities of the people who own tether are not always clear, the movement of the token across national bor...",2018-03-30 20:12:23,bitcoinmagazine,Bitcoin|Investing,Cryptocurrency Exchange Bittrex Introduces Stable Tether-to-TrueUSD Pairing
"                        Bitfinex, the fifth-largest cryptocurrency exchange by 24-hour trading volume, is looking to hoist itself out of Hong Kong and settle in Switzerland, as first reported by Handelszeitung. As confirmed by sources close to Bitfinex, the exchange is already in talks with Swiss authorities.Jean-Louis van der Velde, CEO at Bitfinex, told Handelszeitung, “We are looking for a new home for Bitfinex and the parent company iFinex, where we want to merge the operations previously spread over several locations.”  Van der Velde said that Bitfinex, now based in Hong Kong, was also considering London as a potential new location, but for now, Switzerland remains its first choice. If iFinex pulls off the move successfully, it will form a new AG (or Aktiengesellschaft, which is German for “public company”) to replace the former iFinex in the British Virgin Islands. The company’s core businesses would be based in Switzerland and van der Velde and other managers would likely relocate there as well.In addition, iFinex is also the parent company of Tether, a subsidiary that produces tether (USDT), a token pegged to the U.S. dollar. USTD trades on several exchanges, including Bitfinex, but since no third-party audit has ever taken place, questions linger as to whether the $2.3 billion in USDT so far issued by Tether are backed by actual dollars.Adding to the opaqueness of Bitfinex’s business dealings, since April 2017, Bitfin...",2018-03-28 23:59:25,bitcoinmagazine,Bitcoin|Startups,Cryptocurrency Exchange Bitfinex Plans Move to Switzerland

"                        After facing crackdowns in China and being issued a warning by regulators in Japan, cryptocurrency exchange Binance is now seeking a home on the crypto-friendly island nation of Malta, the company’s CEO Zhao Changpeng told Bloomberg.  Malta is known for extending open arms to fintech and blockchain technology. Malta Prime Minister Joseph Muscat underscored that policy when he shared the Bloomberg piece on Twitter, stating, “We aim to be the global trailblazers in the regulation of blockchain-based businesses and the jurisdiction of quality and choice for world class fintech companies.”Since it was founded in Hong Kong in 2017, Binance has grown rapidly to become the largest exchange in the world by trading volume. Establishing itself in Malta could open doors to even larger growth. Currently, the exchange is negotiating with banks in Malta to set up a formal banking partnership, Zhao told Bloomberg. If it succeeds, that means Binance, which now offers only crypto-to-crypto trading pairs, will be able to offer crypto-to-fiat trading pairs. In that sense, Binance would operate similar to U.S.-based exchange Coinbase, where users have direct links to their bank accounts and can withdraw and deposit fiat. Banking relationships are essential to the livelihood of exchanges. Without the ability to allow customers to move in and out of the fiat world, exchanges turn to stable tokens, like tether (USDT) or trueU...",2018-03-23 21:31:08,bitcoinmagazine,Bitcoin|Regulation,Binance Seeks New Home in Malta’s Fintech-Friendly Environment

"  Concerns are growing as to whether tether (USDT), the stable token pegged to the dollar, is backed by actual U.S. dollars. And recent scrutiny by U.S. regulators is doing nothing to allay those fears. As of this writing, the number of USDT in circulation is 2.2 billion. That means Tether should have a matching number of dollars in one or several bank accounts. But, so far, no external audit has been conducted to show the money actually exists.  Tether is owned and operated by the same individuals who run the largest Bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchange in the world. An unregulated exchange, with no official oversight, Bitfinex handles a daily trading volume of around $2 billion. In 2015, Tether began issuing USDT at a slow pace. But after Bitfinex was cut off from all  formal banking in April 2017, that issuance took on rapid, and later, almost frenzied, pace, with higher and higher volumes being printed each month. During the same  period, the price of bitcoin rose from $1,000 to a peak of $20,000 in mid-December. If regulators were to crack down on Bitfinex/Tether, it is hard to guess what impact that might have on cryptocurrency markets at large. To get a broader picture on the history of Bitfinex and Tether, the following is a timeline of events.  Timeline2012 — iFinex, the company that becomes the parent company for Bitfinex and Tether, is founded in Hong Kong. 2013 — Bitfinex incorporates in Hong Kong.

"As reported by Core Media, a recent security breath in Tether’s treasury wallet led to the theft of nearly $31 million worth of USDT, the tokens the company issues that are supposedly pegged to the USD at a 1:1 ratio.Reacting to the attack, Tether decided to upgrade the Omni Core software, in which it is built on, to lock the stolen tokens and prevent them from entering the cryptocurrency ecosystem. At the time, various exchanges halted USDT trading to upgrade their systems.Recently, a Reddit user dubbed “SpeedflyChris”, in an attempt to learn more about the incident, managed to link the attack to the $5 million Bitstamp hack of 2015, in which about 18,000 BTC, now worth nearly $150 million, were stolen from the Luxembourg-based bitcoin exchange as employees fell victim to a weeks-long phishing attempt.The redditor managed to link the attacks by using a smart bitcoin block explorer that groups addresses into clusters in order to identify its likely owners, WalletExplorer. Through it, he managed to link this wallet, used to collect funds stolen from Bitstamp in 2015, to the Tether attack.Per his research, the address used to collect the stolen Tether funds received .01 BTC before the hack, from the wallet linked to the Bitstamp incident. The deposit, according to SpeedflyChris, was either a way to make sure everything was working properly, or to ensure there was enough BTC there for transaction fees to move the Tethers around.H...",2017-11-22 18:28:24,coremediablockchain,Blockchain News,Data Links $31 Million Tether 'Security Breach' to 2015 Bitstamp Hack
